   - `icons/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
   - `icons/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

2. Use an online SVG to PNG converter
3. Generate PNG files in sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128
4. Save them in the `icons/` folder with the correct names

**Option C: Use the JavaScript Generator**

2. Open browser console and run the script
3. It will automatically download all required PNG files
